This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving the use of reserved keywords as aliases in SQL queries. The `bug.sql` file contains the problematic query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides a corrected version.  The error arises because SQL dialects reserve certain words for specific purposes; attempting to use them as identifiers can lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior. The solution involves choosing an alternative, non-reserved name for the column alias.
